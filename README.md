# Game Concept

This repository lays out the core idea for a future 2D puzzle-adventure game. Players awaken on a mysterious island and must solve environmental riddles to unlock new areas and unravel the story.

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.11 or newer is installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install project dependencies when a requirements file becomes available.

## Usage

Once a prototype exists, start the game with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Until then, the repository serves as a planning space.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Prototype player movement in a basic Pygame window.
- [ ] Implement puzzle objects and interaction system.
- [ ] Design the first playable level.
- [ ] Add saving, loading, and scoring.
- [ ] Improve graphics and sound design.

## Milestones

- **v0.1** – Movement and map prototype.
- **v0.2** – Puzzle mechanics and first level.
- **v1.0** – Complete playable release.
